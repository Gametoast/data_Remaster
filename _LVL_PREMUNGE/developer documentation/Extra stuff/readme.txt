STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II - REMASTER

Extra stuff

This script skips the whole interface and starts the custom_gc_6.lua defined mission directly on startup.
You can combine this with "/nointro" launchparameter to further increase the loadspeed while map or mission
development.
Feel free to use this in anyway you like. Of course you can use any other custom_gc_X number. Depending on
the other scripts you already have installed.
