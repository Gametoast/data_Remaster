STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II - REMASTER

Settings Tutorial

For custom settings we need a new custom lvl with the name 'RTP_option_script.lvl' and an script called
'RTP_option_script' inside this lvl. Define a new function called 'swbf2Remaster_getCustomSettings'. We
don't need to worry about overwriting an existing function or that another script will overwrite our 
function. Remaster will handle to call this function only once and to clean up afterwards. Inside the
function we define a local table that contains the data for each of our settings. You can see the structure
in the example script. Make sure that the tag you are using is unique. Any tags that are used twice will be
ignored. You can use on/off yes/no or any other combination for the button labels. As shown in the example
script you can use Republic/Rebels, too, and later in a gamescript switch the teams depending on the settings.
Of course you can use localize strings, too. Those can be existing once as demonstrated on the example of
the off/on buttons or completely new defined once, as shown for the second title.
You can access the value of your custom settings by using one of the two following code snippets

==CODE=======================================================================
-- Variant 1
local cusTag1State = rema_database.radios.cusTag1

--Variant 2
local cusTag1State = rema_database.radios["cusTag1"]

=============================================================================

The value depends on the order of your button strings. The first string gets value 1 and the second value 2.
After first loading your script on the settings page you need to restart the game to show your buttons on
the settings page.
