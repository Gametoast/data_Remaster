Galactic Conquest Tutorial

In order to add a new custom galactic conquest we need to add a new button on the GC interface screen. So we
need a RTP_interface_script script that hooks into the interface and adds our button to the list. In addition
we need a ifs_freeform_start and a ifs_freeform_init script were we actually define our galactic conquest.
In this example i use the stock rebels vs empire galactic conquest with reduced number of planets. For more
reference about how to write the init and start scripts i recommend to look at the stock ifs_freeform_init_xx
and ifs_freeform_start_xx scripts in the assets/shell/scripts folder.
Let's have a closer look at the interface script. First of all we should load all scripts that we need for our
custom galactic conquest. Finally we need to register the button in the UI. I offer a function that will do
this for you.

==CODE=======================================================================
swbf2Remaster_registerCGCButton(tag, name, startFunc )

=============================================================================

Your button is defined by a unique tag, a name and a start function. The tag needs to be unique, otherwise
the button will be ignored. The name does not need to be unique but it should be. Otherwise you have two or
more buttons that share all the same name, but start different gc matches. You can use localized strings
that you defined in your Core.lvl (or maybe custom string lvl) file. For example "rtp.gc_names.cgc". The
start function is defined in the ifs_freeform_start_cgc script by default.
