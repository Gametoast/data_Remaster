STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II - REMASTER
Developer Documentation by Anakin


Remaster Tutorial

This mod offers different kinds of scripts and features. I will describe shortly what they are about and
how you can use them. For the details I'll refer sometimes to the corresponding tutorial files.
While writing I'm doing all those steps by myself to ensure that they work. This tutorial isn't intended
to be a beginner tutorial. You should already know about SWBF2 modding, e.g. how to munge a custom lvl.
I'm gonna use RTP (Remaster Tutorial Project) as my project ID. You need to change this for you. Further
I'm gonna use my CustomLVL maker tool to munge custom LVLs http://gametoast.com/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=30995

Some general information about the custom scripts:
All scripts will be placed in your GameData\addon\XXX\scripts folder. In order to be loaded the scripts
need to be installed from in the game. For that you need to go to the REMASTER settings page in the game,
change to script manager tab, enter your mod ID to the editbox and press 'install'. If you want to install
multiple mod IDs you can put a list of them seperated by ',' or ' ' in the editbox before you hit 'install'.
In case you don't actually know all the IDs or there are so many new scripts you can pass '*' to the box.
Now the script manager will search all possible 3 letter combinations and search for scripts. The scan 
process will take some time, so i recommand not to use this if you want to install only one new mod. The
install process needs to be done only once, no matter how often you change the script itself. If you delete
the remaster's settings file, or reset the settings to default you need to load the scripts again. A list
of all detected scripts can be found on the script manager tab, too. Depending on the script you may
need to restart the game. Information about this will be given in the corresponding subsections. Make sure
to inform in your readme that the users need to run this process, too, once they installed your mod!

-- Custom HUD

The stock HUD is really not beautiful and of course you have so many ideas how to do it better. Now you
can! In your mission lua add "rema_noHUD = true" to the first line of your ScriptInit() function. Now
the HUD config files won't be loaded. You can do whatever HUD you like and simply load your HUD config
files from your mission. Be aware that ALL hud config files will be removed (1player.hud, 2player.hud,
3player.hud, 4player.hud and hudtransforms.hud). If you only want to change the minimap you need to add
all other parts from the stock .hud  files to your custom one, too. For more information about HUD
development and how to remove only little parts, refer to my detailed HUD tutorial on Gametoast:

-- Custom settings

A completely new feature of this mod is the custom setting support. You can register your own setting on the
Remaster's setting page and access the current state of your option from any other interface or game script.
While you can only add radio buttons to the Remaster's setting page, you can in addition create your complete
own minipage that is accessible through the tab list on the remaster settings. To learn about this continue
with the "Settings Tutorial".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Interface scripts

The v1.3 custom_gc scripts can be used for a lot more than only adding custom galactic conquest. That's why
those scripts are called Interface scripts now. As the name suggest those scripts are loaded when you enter
the menu. You can add wrapper for existing functions, define your own screens, or what ever idea comes to
your mind. Those custom lvl files need to be called 'RTP_interface_script.lvl' and need to contain a
'RTP_interface_script' script. The most common thing those scripts are used for is for adding a custom
galactic conquest. To learn how to do that with the new Interface scripts instead of the v1.3. custom_gc
scripts, continue with the "Galactic Conquest Tutorial".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Game scripts

The v1.3 user scripts are called game script in my Remaster mod. Simple reason for that, it is actually
what those scripts do. They are loaded on the game's start and not in the interface. You can for example
do something depending on your previous registered custom setting. There is not a common thing that is done
with those game scripts, so i don't have an example at this point. Make sure you name your custom lvl
'RTP_game_script.lvl' and the script 'RTP_game_script'. There is no need to restart the game after you
load the script on the setting's page.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Theme scripts

You want to change the background images, font colors or other design elements? This is the script of your
choice. You need to restart the game after you load the script and change the used theme on the setting's
page. To learn about this continue with the "Theme Tutorial".
