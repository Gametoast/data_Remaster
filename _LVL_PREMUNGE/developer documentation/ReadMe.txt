STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II - REMASTER
Developer Documentation by Anakin


ReadMe

This mod changes a lot of the interface and game scripts not only to improve the graphic, but also to add
new possibilities for SWBF II modding. To guarantee compatibility and to use the full potential of SWBF II
modding you need to know how everything works.
Congratulation you did the first step and installed the detailed development documentation! 

Now I didn't break any of the old features so they still can and need to be used. To learn about them I
included the detailed v1.3 patch documentation. It can be found in the v1.3 folder. You should read this first
if you are new to SWBFII modding.

To continue with the Remaster documentation go ahead with "Remaster Tutorial" file.
