# data_Remaster
Star Wars Battlefront II Remastered is an upgrade for the old Star Wars Battlefront II game.
While the gameplay itself already supported higher resolutions the menu interface did not. As a result the galactic conquest looks pixelated and stretched and furthermore there is a very limited amount of supported eras because it is not possible to display more then 5 at once.
This mod contains new HD background images, fixes for the stretched and pixelated content on widescreen Displays and additional support for more eras and game mods. Furthermore this mod comes with soundfixes and ai hero support for ALL eras maps and mods that do not already support it. But if you prefer the pure Battlefront II feeling you can disable this on a new settings page.

Special Thanks to Rayman1103 for this sound fixes and AI Hero script!
